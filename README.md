Hey there 👋

I'm Shahid, a Java and Web Developer based in Karachi, Pakistan.

I mostly work on backend stuff — Spring Boot REST APIs, Laravel web apps, and managing databases with MySQL.

I also use Docker for containerization and Git/GitHub for version control when I need to deploy projects.

This is a fresh profile where I'll be uploading projects I've built during my CS degree at SMIU, internships, and things I'm currently working on. Everything here is built from scratch, no copy/paste templates.

Tools & Tech:
- Java, Spring Boot, Laravel
- MySQL, REST APIs, JWT authentication
- Docker, Git, GitHub Actions
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP

A Bit About Me:
- 🎓 Computer Science student at SMIU (GPA: 3.1/4.0)
- 💼 Completed web development internship at NextGenLearners
- 🚀 Built a Blood Bank Management System handling 500+ records
- 🌐 Into building things that are practical, scalable, and solve real problems
